            <h1>Nostalgic Vibe,</h1>
            <p>
              ðŸŒ™ There was a time when evenings felt slower. The sun dipped
              behind the mango trees, casting golden shadows on cracked verandas
              where stories were whispered over chai. The air smelled of
              monsoon-soaked earth and old books, and laughter echoed from
              rooftops where cousins chased kites tangled in telephone wires.
              Radios hummed with melodies that made hearts ache sweetly, and
              every corner of the house held a secretâ€”a rusted bicycle, a
              forgotten diary, a photo with edges curled by time. Life wasnâ€™t
              perfect, but it was textured, tender, and full of moments that now
              live only in the quiet folds of memory.
